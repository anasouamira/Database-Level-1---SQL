/*
In SQL, DROP DATABASE is used to delete the database in our Database Management System. 
For example:
*/

DROP DATABASE my_database;

-- Here, the SQL command will delete a database named my_database.

-- Also make sure you have admin or DROP permission to run this command.

-- Note: When we delete a database, all tables and records within a database are also deleted.
